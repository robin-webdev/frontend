Hey Claude I was following a Cohort by Sheryians Coding School.
And I just completed JavaScript So now I want to make my notion notes for future references the notes should be short, notion friendly copy paste text, should use code example in coding blocks not anything bs just straight short points. Making it proper notion notes using different heading, and also structure the content properly. Here are the concepts that I have studied so far and wants to make the notes for -
What is JS? What is it used for? And why JS?
