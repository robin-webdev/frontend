Hey Claude I was following a Cohort by Sheryians Coding School.
And I just completed JavaScript So now I want to make my notion notes for future references the notes should be short, notion friendly copy paste text, should use code example in coding blocks not anything bs just straight short points. Making it proper notion notes using different heading, and also structure the content properly. Here are the concepts that I have studied so far and wants to make the notes for -
What is JS? What is it used for? And why JS?
Some of the console api functions like log, confirm, alert, prompt, error, warn, clear, assert, table, info, time, timeEnd and more.
Variable, their rules
let, const and var - and their proper distinction
null vs undefined
Ecma Script
Different types of cases - camel, snake, cabab and pascal
Different Data Types in JS - primitive and not-primitive
typeof keyword
Operators in JS including post and pre unary operator and binary operators and ternary operator
conditional statements
Different types of Loops - for, while, do-while, for of, for in, forWhich etc
Template literals and string interpolation
Escape characters
Most important methods of strings - length, toUpper/lowercase, trim, slice, replace/replaceAll, concat, charAt, indexof
Arrays and their methods - push, pop, toString, shift, unshift, concat, reverse, join, sort, slice, splice
Array.from method, delete keyword for array
Array important methods - map, filter and reduce
Functions in JS and its expression, redundancy, return keyword, arrow functions and the distiction amoung them, call back function, higher order function
Window Object in JS
DOM - Document Object Model
console.log vs console.dir
BOM - Browser Object Model
DOM Manipulation - selection of a html element with id, class and element tag
document.\* - getElementByID/ClassName/TagName and querrySelector/All with the distinction amoung them
some props - tagName, textContent, innerText, nodeName, inner/outerHTML, hasAttribute
Parent-chile-siblings nodes distinction and props
child/parentNode, firstChild, firstElementChild, nextSibling, previousSibling and more
attributes property, get attribute, set attribut, remove,
Data sets for elements in js
styling with js
inserting element - createElement, node.prepend, append, before, after, replaceWith
node.remove()
node.classList - .add, .remove, .toggle
What are Events in JS - mouse, keyboard and more
Inline event handling and with js - node.<event>
Event Object, - .target, .type, .clientX/Y
Event Listeners add/removeEventListener
pure vs impure functions
Closure in detail with a good example
scoping - lexical
location href
writing script before the body tag
Types of node - text, element, comment, descendant, child,
Matches, closest and contains
hidden attribut
insertAdjacentHTML/text/element(location, content) - before/afterBegin, before/afterEnd
SetTimeout and setinterval and their clear methods
Important - Event Bubbling and Event Delegation and .stopPropagation method
Callback and pyramid of doom or callback hell,
asyn vs sync actions, What are Promises, promise object
Consumers - .then() and .catch() .finally()
Promise chaining, Promise API - the 6 methods - all, allSettled, race, any, resolve, reject
Async Await
Fetch API
Different types of API Methods
Temporal Dead Zone
Symbol() in js and its usecase
Number.maxSafeInteger
bigInt and its usecase

Type coercion in js
Truth and falsy values - 0, false, "", null, undefined, NaN, document.all and the rest is true
instanceOf keyword
switch case in js
Difference between HTMLCollection, NodeList and arrays
Error Handling in js - try, catch and finally and err object
synchronous nature of try catch and script dying
Throwing custom errors
Object Oriented Programming
prototypes, [[prototype]], prototypical inheritence, **proto**
classes and objects
constructor function in class
this keyword in class, object, and different types of functions
class inheritence using extends keyword
method overriding, super method
overriding constructors
static methods in oops
getter and setter with a good example
public and private variables
IIFE - for keeping variables private
destructuring, and its different cases
spread operator
shalow copy and deep cloning
Hoisting with let const and var and fuctions
Date Object - current date and time, specific data and time
methods - getFullyear/month...., setFullyear/...
Date.now()
Local Storage approx storage, localstorage.setItem/getItem/removeItem.clear
JSON.parse and stringify
Object methods -> Object.\* - keys, values, entries, freeze, assign, seal
Arrays methods -> some, every, find, sort, findIndex, includes - include callback functions
Scroll related functions - window.scrollTo(x,y)/scrollBy/scrollIntoView/onScroll, node.scrollHeight
Sessions storage and its use case
Cookies and its usecase adding updating adn deleting a cookie
cookie props like expires, path etc
function statement vs function expression
obj.name vs obj[name]
Optional chaining
obj = {[variab] : "Robin"}
Event capturing
block global and functional scope 
execution context -> memory phase and execution phase
dynamic scoping and lexical scoping
different values of this keyword in different cases
apply call and bind
prototype vs __proto__
Math.random() and Math.floor()
node.appendChild
Everything to know about JSON
Intersection observer and its ex
class hoisting
OOPs without class keyword using functions - the old school method
js being single threaded language
call stack, event loop, threads, multi-threading
Debouncing and throttling with ex
Design patterns in js - module, revealing module, factory function, observer pattern
performace optimization - lazy loading using intersect observer, dataset for images, code splitting amoung modules
createDocumentFragment();
separation of concern (dom vs logic)
task queue
different types of language - scripting , programming etc
difference between double and single quotes
statement vs expression
nullish collecing operator
leading and trailing spaces
arguments object
rest parameters
