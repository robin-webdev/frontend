Alright, no worries about that, as I just finished my CSS Lectures from the course that I was doing (Sheryians Coding School Cohort 2.O), now I want to prepare notes for my notion, like I did for HTML. And I don't know spend hours of my precious time to just sit and write everything down by myself.

So I want you to prepare notes of CSS for me, It should be short notes, just to go throuh whenever I want to. I will mention everything that you need to cover in the notes this time don't write anything about css, I will provide you my HTML Notes that we have made and you just need to analyze how You are supposed to be making my CSS notes. Again don't make the notes now just analyse and let me know if it clear to you.
